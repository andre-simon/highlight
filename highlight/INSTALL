2. Dependencies
===============

In order to compile highlight, you need to install Lua (5.x or LuaJIT as
devel package) and Boost (at least the header files).
The optional GUI requires Qt (4 or 5) and its development tools (qmake).


3. Compilation and installation
===============================

3.1 Linux
---------

 1. tar xjf highlight-x.x.tar.bz2

 2. cd highlight-x.x

 3. make help

 4. make / make cli   (compile static library and the CLI interface)
    make lib-static   (optional, compile static library only)
    make lib-shared   (optional, compile shared library only)
    make gui          (optional, compile static library and the Qt GUI)

 5, make install
    (depending on your installation destination, you need to be root)

 6. make install-gui (optional)
    Install additional files if you have compiled the highlight GUI binary.
    (depending on your installation destination, you need to be root)

 7. make clean (optional)

 After the compilation of the CLI or GUI, a library (libhighlight.a) was
 generated which may be used for other C++ projects.

 Highlight's default data directory is /usr/share/highlight.
 You may alter this directory at compile time or at run time:
 - See the makefile how to add a compiler directive which defines an
   installation directory (data_dir variable)
 - See the makefile to change the configuration file directory
   (conf_dir variable)
 - See section CONFIG FILE SEARCH in README for run time options


3.2 Windows
-----------

Install the following tools and libraries.

a) Install Qt Creator IDE (www.qt.io)

b) Install MingW (gcc toolchain)

    -Download Online-Installer: 
     https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/
    -Start mingw-w64-install.exe and select default options
    -Add bin directory of the downloaded files to the system PATH
    -open cmd.exe and type "g++ --version" to check

c) Compile Qt:

    -Download and extract package from qt.io:
     https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ -> qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.6.0.tar.gz
    -Open cmd.exe and change into the Qt directory
    -Configure Qt. Use static if you do not want to ship Qt DLLs:
     configure -release -opensource -confirm-license -static  -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-freetype -qt-sql-sqlite -no-openssl -nomake examples -opengl  desktop
    -Compile Qt:
     mingw32-make -k -j4

d) Add compiler and Qt paths (location of qmake.exe) in QtCreator

e) Install Boost

    -Download and extract package from boost.org (no compilation needed)

f) Compile Lua 

    -Download source package: https://www.lua.org/download.html
    -Open QtCreator and create a new Project ("without Qt")
    -Import all c files of the Lua package except lua.c and luac.c
    -Edit the project file like this: 
    
     TEMPLATE = lib
     CONFIG += console
     CONFIG -= app_bundle
     CONFIG -= qt
     DEFINES -= UNICODE
     SOURCES += $$files(../lua-5.3.0/src/*.c)
     SOURCES -= ../lua-5.3.0/src/lua.c ../lua-5.3.0/src/luac.c

    -Compile the Lua library

g) Install upx from http://upx.sourceforge.net/

h) Open the pro files in src/w32-projects and src/gui_qt in QtCreator and 
   adjust the paths of libraries and tools. Compile the lib project first.

i) Ship highlight with libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll (32 bit) libgcc_s_seh-1.dll (64 bit)  libstdc++-6.dll libwinpthread-1.dll
   (all DLLs are located in the mingw32 installation)

4. Known compiler issues
========================

Highlight was tested with gcc > 4.8. It will not compile with gcc 2.x.
For gcc versions < 4.7, unique_ptr needs to be replaced by auto_ptr.


5. LaTeX unicode support
========================

To enable UTF-8 support in LaTeX, the ucs package has to be installed.
See the following package names or sources:

Fedora: tetex-unicode
SuSE:   latex-ucs


6. Lazy pointer issue under MacOS X
===================================

Stripping the highlight binary causes program termination at runtime:

dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: lazy pointer not found
dyld: lazy pointer not found
Trace/BPT trap

To avoid this issue, edit the makefile to not strip the binary after
linkage (see src/makefile, LDFLAGS variable).


7. Static linking (to run highlight as service)
===============================================

If highlight cannot be run as service because of shared linkage, link
it with the -static option (see src/makefile, LDFLAGS variable).


8. Known distribution issues
============================

Linux Mint

There is a system script called highlight which is located in a preferenced path: 

mintsystem provides: /usr/local/bin/highlight
 highlight provides: /usr/bin/highlight

Calling this script with the true highlight command line options will have no effect.
